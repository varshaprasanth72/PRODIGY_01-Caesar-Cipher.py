Caesar Cipher Tool
The Caesar Cipher Tool is a simple Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher technique.

How it Works
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example:

With a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.
With a shift of -1, 'B' would become 'A', 'C' would become 'B', and so on.
Usage
Encrypt a Message

Choose option 1 from the menu.
Enter the message you want to encrypt.
Enter the shift value (an integer representing how many positions each letter in the message should be shifted).
The program will output the encrypted message.
Decrypt a Message

Choose option 2 from the menu.
Enter the message you want to decrypt.
Enter the shift value (the same value used to encrypt the message).
The program will output the decrypted message.
Exit

Choose option 3 from the menu to exit the program.
Getting Started
To use the Caesar Cipher Tool, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from here.

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory where the program is located.
Run the program by executing python caesar_cipher.py in your terminal.
